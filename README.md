# Hopf-fibration-hyperboloid
<p>
This site shows a visualization of the Hopf fibration.
Visualization is performed both for Hopf circles and for straight lines 
taken instead of these circles. As a result of such visualization, 
a hyperboloid appears instead of a torus.
<br>
The visualization was performed using quantum rotations on the Riemann-Bloch sphere.
